# ACE Admission Webhook

## Functionality

This project implements a custom [validating admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) that validates the creation and update of ACE IntegrationServer instances. The admission controller is written in [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/) and is packaged as a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart.

It performs validation of an ACE integration server.

## Building

Compile the go code as follows:

export CGO_ENABLED=0

go build -o bin/webhook main.go

Build the image. Example uses podman.

./buildImage.sh
 

## Installing

The admission WebHook is packaged as a Helm chart. The pipeline [deploy.yaml](deploy.yaml) uses Helm to deploy the Helm chart. The admission controller should be installed in every ACE OCP cluster.

The following chart [values](helm/ace-server-validating-webhook/values.yaml) may be set:

* isProduction

    A boolean that determines whether or not the OCP cluster is a production environment. Default: false.

* containerRegistry

    The host name of the container registry ACE container images must be pulled from. Default: ca.icr.io/mverhiel

Install command:

helm install ace-server-validating-webhook ace-server-validating-webhook

Label namespaces that you deploy ACE integration servers to and want to be validated as follows:

  app.ibm.com/kind: cp4i
