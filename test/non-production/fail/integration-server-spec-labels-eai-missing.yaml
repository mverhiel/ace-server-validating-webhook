    # Controls behavior of the operator
    # This version is used by the ACE operator and determines what features are available.
    # A given operator version will only support a certain set of versions.
    #
    # When using custom containers, it is NOT necessarily the version of ACE code running in the container!
    # The base container image determines the version of ACE that is running.
    #
    # If the using an external repo for BAR files (the barURL property), the operator will download the
    # base image to use, add the bar files, start pods using the container that was built.
    # By default, the operator will download container images from IBM (which will require an entitlement key and
    # credentials to be configured).
    #
    # When using the external BAR file approach, the version must be set to a version supported by the operator. Operator
    # updates will be blocked if there are integration server instances running running on versions that are no
    # longer supported. Application development teams would need to update the version to a supported version,
    # update the licence info, restart integration server pods, test.
